🐧 Penguins Binary Classification using Logistic Regression
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates a binary classification task using Logistic Regression on the Palmer Penguins dataset. The goal is to predict the species of penguins based on their physical characteristics.
📁 Dataset
The dataset used: penguins_binary_classification.csv

It is a modified version of the original Palmer Penguins dataset, tailored for a binary classification task (e.g., distinguishing between two species: Adelie and Gentoo).

Features include:
Bill length

Bill depth

Flipper length

Body mass

Island

Sex

Target:
Species (binary: 0 or 1)

🧪 Task
Perform binary classification using Logistic Regression.

Steps covered:
Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature scaling

Train-test split

Model training with logistic regression

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve)
